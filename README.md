## Algorithms Project - Subset Sum

This project is a play on the "subset sum" problem. It finds all possible subsets that sum up to a target value.
It can be run by entering the following commands:

	$ g++ -o main main.cpp
	$ ./main TARGET_VALUE Projdata1.txt

Once the program runs, if there was no sum, the problem prints out "Not feasible". However, if it was possible, the
program prints the following lines:

Yay, there exist subsets that satisfy the subset-sum problem!
There are (x) total subsets that add to (T).
The size of the smallest subset is (x).
There is (x) distinct subset that that adds to (T) of size (x).
